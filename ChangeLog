    iw_cxgb4/libcxgb4: swsq "signaled" state needs to mind sq_sig_all.
    
    When a qp is created, the ULP can request that all sq wrs be signaled.
    The swsqe entries need to take this into account when marking the entry
    as signaled.
    
    This bug will cause read request CQEs to be silently discarded, and can
    cause flush problems because the swsqe entry will be mismarked for qps
    created with sq_sig_all set in the qp init attributes.

    never consume a pending wr in sq flush.
    
    There is a race when moving a QP from RTS->CLOSING where a SQ work
    request could be posted after the FW receives the RDMA_RI/FINI WR.
    The SQ work request will never get processed, and should be completed
    with FLUSHED status.  Function c4iw_flush_sq(), however was dropping
    the oldest SQ work request when in CLOSING or IDLE states, instead of
    completing the pending work request. If that oldest pending work request
    was actually complete and has a CQE in the CQ, then when that CQE is
    proceessed in poll_cq, we'll BUG_ON() due to the inconsistent SQ/CQ state.
    
    This is a very small timing hole and has only been hit once so far.
    
    c4iw_flush_sq() MUST always flush all non-completed WRs with FLUSHED
    status regardless of the QP state.

    always do GTS write if cidx_inc == M_CIDXINC.
    
    When polling, we do a GTS update if the accumulated cidx_inc == the cq
    depth / 16.  This works around a T4 bug.  However, if the cq is large
    enough, cq depth / 16 exceeds the size of the field in the GTS word.
    So we also need to update if cidx_inc hits M_CIDXINC to avoid overflowing
    the field.

    fixed bug where sq.udb was getting overwritten.
    
    There was an erroneous statement in create_rc_qp() which caused the
    sq.udb va to be overwritten with the rq.udb va only for on-chip queues.
    This error only affected unmapping of that mapped va when destroying
    a qp.  In the presence of multiple threads creating/destroying qps, the
    erroneously unmapped va could have been assigned to another qp mapping.
    This causes intermittent seg faults as libcxgb4 tries to access memory
    that has been unmapped in error.

    libcxgb4: unmap the correct udb/ugts address.
    
        The various db and gts variables holding the mapped bar2 pointer
        get incremented at creation time as a normal part of object creation.
        However this causes the wrong address to get unmapped when the object is
        destroyed.  The result is a mapping leak because the munmap() fails.
        So align them back to their proper page boundary when calling munmap().

    flush bug can cause application crash
    
    This fixes a problem in the flush logic that could occur if the
    current position is near the end of the queue and the 'count' being
    retired plus this position was greater than the queue size. In this
    case the index wasn't being wrapped and the associated swcqe pointer
    would point past the end of the CQ.
    
    Asserts were added to check other possible wrap-error paths.

    libcxgb4: return -ENOSYS in c4iw_resize_cq().
    
    I fixed a "bug" in c4iw_resize_cq() in an earlier commit which regressed
    us.  c4iw_resize_cq() was returning 0 always even though we don't support
    resizing the CQ.  So I change libcxgb4 to return whatever errno is
    returned by the kernel driver.   However, because the driver didn't set
    the uverbs capabilities for resize_cq, uverbs returned EINVAL.  The OMPI
    code checks for -ENOSYS and handles providers that don't support it.
    If, however, ibv_resize_cq() returns any other error, OMPI bails out.
    So we need to return -ENOSYS.
    
    I didn't see this error, however, running NP192 OMPI/IMB all night long.
    So it must only try to resize for small jobs and thus I missed the
    regression.

    libcxgb4: Correctly flush unsignaled WRs followed by a signaled WR.
    
    The cq flush logic was not accounting for unsignaled SQ WRs followed by
    a signaled WR.  The result was too many flushed CQEs causing application
    faults or assert() failures in libcxgb4 because the SQ state is corrupted.

    Support variable sized work requests.
    
    T4 EQ entries are in multiples of 64B.  Currently the RDMA SQ and RQ
    use fixed sized entries composed of 4 EQ entries for the SQ and 2 EQ
    entries for the RQ.  For optimial latency with small IO, we need to
    change this so the HW only needs to DMA the EQ entries actually used by
    a given work request.
    
    Implementation:
    
    - add wq_pidx counter to track where we are in the EQ.  cidx/pidx are
    used for the sw sq/rq tracking and flow control.
    
    - the variable part of work requests is the SGL.  Add new functions to
    build the SGL and/or immediate data directly in the EQ memory wrapping
    when needed.
    
    - adjust the min burst size for the EQ contexts to 64B.

    Avoid CQ arm overflows.
    
    There are 2 limits that need to be taken into account when arming the CQ.
    1) the GTS register limits the delta idx to <= M_CIDXINC.
    2) T4 HW limits it to < cq size.
    
    Update t4_arm_cq() to account for these limits.
