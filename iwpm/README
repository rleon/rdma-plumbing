iWarp Port Mapper Daemon - iwpmd

DESCRIPTION

iwpmd provides a user space service (iwpmd) for the iWarp drivers
to claim tcp ports through the standard socket interface.
The drivers currently using the service are Intel nes and Chelsio cxgb4.

PREREQUISITES

iwpmd requires libnl-1 or higher version and the corresponding libnl-devel
to be installed.

The kernel space support for the port mapper is part of the iw_cm module.
The ib_core module includes netlink support, which is used by the port mapper 
clients to exchange messages with iwpmd. Both modules iw_cm and ib_core need to 
be loaded in order for the iwpmd service to start successfully.

If the iwpmd is installed, but the required modules aren't loaded, you need to
load the modules and then restart the iwpmd service.

STARTING THE SERVICE

After installing an OFED package which includes iwpmd, the service should start 
automatically after reboot.

To check if the service is running:
ps aux | grep iwpmd

To start/stop the iwpmd service use:
service iwpmd start
service iwpmd stop

With systemd, to start/stop the iwpmd service use:
systemctl start iwpmd
systemctl stop iwpmd
